# TETORIS: The Game

This Game is a Tetris-like game i made in C for a school project. it based on the TETORIS song by 柊マグネタイト. i love it so i made my game based on this. Enjoy !

# Build & Run

to compile on linux just do sh ./compil.sh and it will compile.

as for windows, install MSYS2 here : https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases

choose latest '.exe' file and execute. then launch the UCRT shell (other will not work with the file i made)

then go to the project folder and do sh ./compil_win.sh

NOTE : NO, IT WILL NOT WORK ONLY WITH THE EXE, Shell only (for now) maybe i'll add the libraries after, i'll see what i can do.

# Controls
UP: Turn Blocks
LEFT: Go left
RIGHT: Go right
Down: blocks fall faster
M: disable music =(
ESC: Menu

Commands Inside Menu:
R: Reset Game
Q: Quit

# Known bugs
Sometimes animation can be laggy (as i'm starting into c animations) so if blocks is not orientated as it should be just close the game and restart using ./Tetoris or ./Tetoris.exe for windows.

# FAQ
